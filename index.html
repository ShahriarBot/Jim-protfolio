            <h3 class="heading3">Jim is a ............ girl. <sapan class="span-jim">But I love her.</sapan>
            </h3>
            <p class="jim-hint">She doesn't listen to me and breaks her promise to me.
                I can't explain it to <span class="span-j">JIM</span> how much I love her.
                Oneday she can understand very beautifully but she won't find me.
                Beacuse She gives me pain all the time. She forgot I was a life and
                I was also feelings,heart and emitions. Oneday She can find me very hardly but she won't succeed it.
                Beacuse he went to leave but not to came back. And where he does not have the predominance of wanting a
                little, how will his predominance be?
                So, it is better for him stay away from there.
                When he go without <span class="span-j">JIM JANNAT</span>
                then he cannot back for her. Beacuse he has gone through a lot of pain.
                There waas some people who leave in such a way and never come back and <span
                    class="span-j">SHIFAT</span> is
                one of those people<br>
                So, Be minded and Carefully.
